What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Creates a hidden folder that will keep all our controlled versions.
No version control until git is actually initialized in that directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is where we put all files concerned by that "logical change" we want
to make in our commit. WD is the physical directory with all the files on disk.
Repository is all files and their versions
